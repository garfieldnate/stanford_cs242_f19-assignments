This was an interesting exercise, and there are a few points I'm still
unsure of:

* Are my schema rules okay? I feel weird about the way I handled
objects, with separate KV and KVL matching rules.
* Did I correctly handle the mapping case in the proof of successful
accessor execution? That felt very kludgey.
* Is S-Terminate really the correct required fourth rule in the
operational semantics? It feels redundant.

Since I'm not in the class for real, I can't ask for help. But I still think it's helpful to try the assignment and think about the shortcomings that I would discuss if I had a TA or study group.

Also, writing in LaTeX freaking sucks. I want function syntax to look like this: `\matches(a,b)`. That would be way less typing! There are way too many curly braces here.
